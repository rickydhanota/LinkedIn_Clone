#See below for things which I'll be incorporating into this project:
#We're using redux as well, when I did npx create-react-app I also did --template redux
#Using firebase for deployment and as a backend
#Using BEM naming convention
#Doing authentication with firebase

#Using Redux to avoid running into the issue of prop drilling. Prop drilling can be a big problem with bigger projects which makes apps hard to maintain
#Redux allows us to manage the flow of data within an application
# using forwardRef from react-flip-move



#ISSUES:
# I could not get my profile/avatar image to come up
# FlipMove is not working properly for when I post something, however, when I refresh the animation works
