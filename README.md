Features I tried to incorporate:
- Material UI
- redux and redux toolkit
- Used firebase for deployment, backend, validations, authentications, etc.
- Used react-flip-move for some animations
- Created components within components which made coding this demo fun. I passed props to help with the modularization of certain components such as the Header.js file and HeaderOption.js file.
- Also used built in functions within certain components such as Widgets.js where I declared a function and passed in some inputs which allowed me to quickly create “news articles”. I think in a practical case I’d much rather build a specific component for this but this just made this quicker to build

Issues I faced:
- I could not get the avatar image to show up, not sure what the issue was here
- Flipmove also did not work properly, however, when I refresh the animation works.
